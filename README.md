Just created it to understand what is a repository.
I am an electrical engineer. The industry now required a person who knows both software and hardware part of things we deal with. I was trained to understand and model electrical systems. Now my role is to connect these systems to digital world and make the world a much better place to live. So inorder to understand the missing link I am here in GitHub to browse some peoples wonderful works in this regard and elevate myself with software knowhows.
